Hi!

As of February 2026, I have mostly moved my git activity off of GitHub.

"Generative AI" and "Large Language Models" are:
1. Highly unethical.
2. Destroying our environment (and our planet).
3. Full of copyright infringment (I have personally found traces of Intel FSP source code within ChatGPT).
4. Created purely for the sake of profit.
5. Produce low-quality results, full of bugs and security vulnerabilities.
6. Simply useless. You don't need an overclocked text predictor to do your job.

Therefore, I do not consent to having such models being trained on my code.

I've made my choice: I'm out... or at least I would like to be.

Unfortunately I still need a GitHub account for work-related purposes so I can't delete it outright.

If you're looking for my current activity, you'll find it on:
- Main: [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/ellyqw)
- Other misc stuff: [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/ellyq)
- coreboot: [Gerrit](https://review.coreboot.org/q/owner:ahplka19@gmail.com)
- Mobile Linux: postmarketOS [GitLab](https://gitlab.postmarketos.org/ellyq) and [wiki](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/User:Ellyqw)
- VR and related: [Freedesktop GitLab](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/ellyq)

Naturally, I'm active and reachable on IRC networks if you have any questions:
- [hackint](https://hackint.org/)
- [Libera](https://libera.chat/)
- [OFTC](https://www.oftc.net/)

You can usually find me hanging out in rooms related to:
- ARM64 Linux (armlinux, aarch64-laptops, asahi*)
- Distributions (alpine*, chimera-linux, gentoo, postmarketos*)
- Firmware development (coreboot, barebox, u-boot)
- Various other Linux-related chats (SoC-related channels like gs101, sm8250 etc.)
